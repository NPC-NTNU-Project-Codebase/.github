## NPC - NTNU Project Codespace Organization Guidelines

Welcome to the **NPC-NTNU Project Codespace** GitHub organization!  
This is the central hub for projects, tools, and resources related to research and development at **NTNU & AURLab**, with a focus on **autonomous marine robotics**.  

Here you‚Äôll find repositories maintained by PhD candidates, MSc students, and collaborators. These projects support both research activities and course-related learning.  

---

## üìö What You‚Äôll Find Here  

- **Course Resources**  
  Shared materials from NTNU courses (lectures, exercises, exams, etc.) that can support your studies and research.  

- **Research Codebases**  
  Experimental and production-level repositories for robotics algorithms, mission planning, path planning, and system integration.

## üìù Guidelines  

To keep our work organized and useful for everyone:  

1. **Collaboration**  
   - Contribute to existing repositories when possible, instead of creating duplicates.  
   - Use Issues and Pull Requests for discussions and code reviews.  

2. **Repository Structure**  
   - Each repo should include a clear `README.md` explaining purpose, setup, and usage.  
   - Follow consistent naming (e.g., `project-name_module` or `course-materials_xxx`).  

3. **Code Practices**  
   - Write clean, documented code.  
   - Follow language-specific style guides (Python PEP8, C++ ROS2 standards, etc.).  
   - Add tests or examples whenever possible.  

4. **Access & Membership**  
   - Send your GitHub username to the organization admins to gain access.  
   - Use private repos for sensitive material; open-source when possible.  

5. **Respect & Professionalism**  
   - Be constructive in feedback.  
   - Respect licensing and acknowledge sources.
